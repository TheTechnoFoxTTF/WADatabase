## About The Project

<!--[![Glimpse][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/yuvrajraghuvanshis/WhatsApp-Key-Database-Extractor)-->

This project is inspired by [EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor](https://github.com/EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor). Since Android v4.0+ Google has removed adb backup and apps no longer supported being backed up by "adb backup -f myApp.ab -apk com.foobar.app". However there is one catch in this scenario and that is some old version of many apps including WhatsApp support that to this day, and that's the idea...

The idea is to install "Legacy Version" of WhatsApp on you device via adb and use "adb backup"  to fetch files from "/data/data/com.whatsapp" folder which includes both the 'key' and 'msgstore.db' (non encrypted) file and after that restore current WhatsApp.


### Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (for Linux and OS X)
#### Depends upon    
* [Java](https://www.java.com/) (To extract backup)

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/aqua.png)

## Getting Started

Before doing anything take a backup of your chats and turn off your phone's internet so you don't lose any new messages.
For that go to 'WhatsApp Settings &#8594; Chat Settings &#8594; Chat Backup' here take a local bacakup. Prepare for Worst.               
After [intallation](#installation) follow on screen instructions.

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
* [ADB Drivers](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) 
* USB Debugging must be enabled on the target device. Settings &#8594; Developer Options &#8594; (Debugging) USB debugging  
     If you cannot find Developer Options then please go to: Settings &#8594; About phone/device and tap the Build number multiple times until you're finally declared a developer.

```
2. Get python requirements
```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install dependencies (for linux and OSX only)
```bash
chmod +x bin/linux_dependencies.sh
sudo ./bin/linuxdependencies.sh
```
4. Run `wa_kdbe.py`
```python
python3 wa_kdbe.py
```

**Command Line Flags**

| Flag            |               | Type          | Behaviour     | Status     |
| -------------   | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| --allow-reboot      | Optional      | Bool | Reboots device before installing Legacy WhatsApp. | Stable |
| --tcp-ip < IP >    | Optional      | String | Connects to a remote device via TCP mode. | Beta |
| --tcp-port < Port >     | Optional     | String | Port number to connect to. Default : 5555. | Beta |
| --scrcpy      | Optional      | Bool | Show device screen as a window using ScrCpy. | Alpha |
| --fast      | Optional      | Bool | Try to speed up process by taking apk backup inside phone and reinstalling from there. | Stable |

python wa_kdbe.py --allow-reboot --tcp-ip 192.168.43.130 --tcp-port 5555 --scrcpy
```

### Standalone Operations
**These operations are standalone implementation of their defined task. One should run these when specifically needed. For ex : Process finished but WhatsApp was not reinstalled on device.**

1. Run `view_extract.py` : To 'fluff' whatsapp.ab to whatsapp.tar and extract files.
```
python3 view_extract.py
```
IMP : For this to work there should be 'whatsapp.ab' file either in 'extracted/<userName>' folder or in 'tmp' folder.

2. Run `protect.py` : To compress/decompress user folder with(out) password for safekeeping.
```
python3 protect.py
```
IMP : For this to work there should either be "userName" folder or "userName.7z" file in 'extracted' folder. Where "userName" is reference user name you entered earlier.

3. Run `restore_whatsapp.py` : To reinstall WhatsApp on device.
```
python3 restore_whatsapp.py
```


### Features & ToDo
<!--https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/wiki/Emoji-->

*  :heavy_check_mark: Extracts msgstore.db from /data/data/com.whatsapp. (duh)
*  :heavy_check_mark: Works wirelessly without USB cable using "ADB over TCP" with `--tcp-ip IP --tcp-port PORT` flags.
*  :heavy_check_mark: See and control your android phone with your computer using [ScrCpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) using `--scrcpy` flag. {Working only in Windows.}
*  :heavy_check_mark: Works with any android device v4.0+ so far.
*  :heavy_check_mark: Works with any android device no matter where it is in universe as long as it is running ADB over TCP.
*  :heavy_check_mark: Moves msgstore.db to your phone.
*  :heavy_check_mark: Creates password protected 7z file so keep your extraction safe.
*  :heavy_check_mark: Continues without JAVA installed and make "whatsapp.tar" out of "whatsapp.ab" once java is installed by running `python view_extract.py`.
*  :heavy_check_mark: Command line arguments
*  :heavy_check_mark: ADB Devices menu.
*  :heavy_check_mark: Implement datetime.
*  :heavy_minus_sign: Extracts backup created over TCP {bin\tar.exe: Unexpected EOF on archive file in Windows.}.


### Demo
Coming soon...



### Troubleshooting

* If list is empty close terminal, remove and replug the device, and re-run the script. [Read More](https://github.com/YuvrajRaghuvanshiS/WhatsApp-Key-Database-Extractor/issues/11#issuecomment-768500899)
* If you have never used USB Debugging before, you may also need to verify the fingerprint by ticking the checkbox and tapping 'allow' on device popup.  
* If you have set a default backup password in your Android settings, then this MUST be the  backup password that you PROVIDE when prompted to backup your data. Else it WILL fail!  
* If you get an error saying "AES encryption not allowed" then you need to update your Oracle Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.  
* WhatsApp crashing? Run `python3 restore_whatsapp.py`. Or "clear data/storage" / uninstall and reinstall from Play Store.
* In MIUI, `Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED: Install canceled by user]` occurs during installation of LegacyWhatsapp.apk, fix it by [allowing install via adb](https://github.com/YuvrajRaghuvanshiS/WhatsApp-Key-Database-Extractor/issues/16#issuecomment-768927639)
* if `[INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE]` run with `--allow-reboot` flag. : `python wa_kdbe.py --allow-reboot`

## Limitations

There always are limitations on how much we can make it work  and this is what allows us to keep going. Well no matter what I do sometimes this tool just won't work on some devices and if that's your case you can try [this fork of MarcoG3's WhatsDump](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/WhatsDump) by [Alessandro Maggio](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/).

## Agreement

I made this project because it was hard for me to kill time and the other one was very old. 
This tool is provided "as-is" and hence you will be responsible however you use it. Cheers☕
