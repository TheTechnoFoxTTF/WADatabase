## About the Project

This project is inspired by [EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor](https://github.com/EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor). Since Android v4.0+ Google has removed adb backup  and apps no longer supported being abcked up by "adb backup -f myApp.ab -apk com.foobar.app". However there is one catch in this scenario and that is some old version of many apps including WhatsApp support that to this day, and that's the idea...

The idea is to install "Legacy Version" of WhatsApp on you device via adb and use "adb backup"  to fetch files from "/data/data/com.whatsapp" folder which includes both the 'key' and 'msgstore.db' (non encrypted) file and after that restore current WhatsApp.

It is build with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (for Linux and OS X) and depends on [Java](https://www.java.com/) (to extract backup).

## Getting Started

Before doing anything take a backup of your chats and turn off your phone's internet so you don't lose any new messages.
For that go to 'WhatsApp settings\Chat Settings\Chat Backup' here take a local bacakup. Prepare for Worst.               
After [intallation](#installation) follow on screen instructions.

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
* [ADB Drivers](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) 
* USB Debugging must be enabled on the target Android device. Settings -> Developer Options -> (Debugging) USB debugging  
     If you cannot find Developer Options then please go to: Settings -> About phone/device and tap the Build number 10 times until you're declared a developer.

Enter the follwing code into the terminal of your choice, on Windows for example cmd.exe. Remember to got into the folder of the code first (via cd). 

1. Clone / download the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuvrajraghuvanshis/WhatsApp-Key-Database-Extractor.git
```
2. Get python requirements
```python
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. For linux and OSX: Install Dependencies 
```bash
chmod +x bin/linux_dependencies.sh
sudo ./bin/linuxdependencies.sh
```
4. Run `wa_kdbe.py`
```python
python3 wa_kdbe.py

4.1 "Choose device from 'List of devices attached'": Here you have to copy-paste the name of your device from the devices list above.

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/aqua.png)

### Troubleshooting

```bash
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
0123a4b5678	device
emulator-5554 unauthorized
```
* If you have never used USB Debugging before, you may also need to verify the fingerprint.  
* If you have set a default backup password in your Android settings, then this MUST be the  backup password that you PROVIDE when prompted to backup your data. Else it WILL fail!  
* If you get an error saying "AES encryption not allowed" then you need to update your Oracle Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.  
* WhatsApp crashing? Run `python3 restore_whatsapp.py`. Or "clear data/storage" / uninstall and reinstall from Play Store.
